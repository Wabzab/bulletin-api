# bulletin-api
You have been employed by the National Government to create an inter departmental bulletin
board. The government aims to use this bulletin board to post issues that need to be solved by
more than one department in conjunction. The issues that will be posted here are of a highly
confidential nature â€“ thus this system must:
- Be developed with very strong security;
- Only allow authorized users to utilize the system. 

## Requirements
You will need the dependencies defined in the `package.json` file.
While in the project directory, run:

`npm install`

This will install all required dependencies for the project.
